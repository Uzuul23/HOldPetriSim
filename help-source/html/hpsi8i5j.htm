<p>
HPSim was developed to support the design and simulation of Petri Nets, both in a graphical and intuitive manner. The software features Place/Transition Nets, Stochastic Petri Nets and Petri Nets with Time.</p>
<p>
The size and complexity of a developed Petri Net is only limited by the performance of the used computer. E.g. with a current use ordinary PC (let’s say: PII, 300MHz, 128MB), it is still convenient to edit and simulate a project with several nets, and each net with 1000’s of objects.</p>
<p>
The actual simulation is visualized as a Token Game Animation. This can be executed in single step or continuous mode. Besides that,  a fast forward mode is also available, in which the graphical representation of the token is not synchronized with the simulated actual position.</p>
