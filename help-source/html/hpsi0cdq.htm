<ul>
<li>
We emphasize the net boundaries with a rectangle. For that reason, we select the menu entry “Tools<font face="Wingdings"><span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#224;</span></font>Rect”, and draw a rectangle by dragging the mouse cursor in the document.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can positioning the rectangle any time later on by clicking with the mouse somewhere on its area – you can not position or drag an object when any other tool than “Tools<font face="Wingdings"><span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#224;</span></font>Select” is chosen before - and dragging the object to the desired position. Resizing is done by clicking on the mouse handles of the selected object (small gray squares on the rim and corners of an object).<br><br></li>
<li>
Since it is possible to vertically pile graphical objects up, you need to specify, which of the objects you like to have in the background and which in the foreground (you can intentionally take advantage of this feature that objects can cover each other, when drawing sophisticated graphical objects). In this case, we like to have the drawn rectangle to be in the background. This is down by first selecting the rectangle and then choosing the menu entry “Pushback” of the context menu (context menu is invoke by clicking the right mouse button over the current object).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
We want to give the net the descriptive title ”Gambling Machine”. Select the menu entry “Tools<font face="Wingdings"><span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#224;</span></font>Text” and click with the mouse cursor on the desired position of the text. Unselect the current mouse tool by selecting the menu entry “Tools<font face="Wingdings"><span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#224;</span></font>Select”. Right-click on the text and select the menu entry “Text” from the context menu. Type the desired text as shown below.<br><br></li>
<li>
Of course, you can use the text object to write extensive descriptions.</li>
