<p>
The application can be started by executing the file HPSim.exe. To facilitate the daily work with the program, a short cut on the desktop or in the start menu can be created. </p>
<p>
When running HPSim for the first time, HPSim enters the file extension *.hps in the registry, so that HPSim-files will be recognized by the operating system, and a double-click on a hps-file will start HPSim.</p>
