<h2><a name="label"></a>Label</h2>
<p>
The label holds a special meaning among the passive graphical objects.</p>
<p>
The user can not delete or add labels.</p>
<p>
Labels are always automatically attached when a graphical object (further referenced as owner of the label) is created, and represents a property of it.</p>
<p>
The position of the label to the attached graphical object can be changed by dragging it with the mouse. When the graphical object is moved, the label is automatically moved along.</p>
<p>
The value of the label is only changed, when the property of its attached graphical object (owner) has changed.</p>
