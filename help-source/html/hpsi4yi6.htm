A net model is represented by a document in HPSim. The document consists of elements, which are considered as a net for simulation. An interaction of elements of different documents is not possible. Even though HPSim – as a MDI (Multiple Document Interface) – can handle several open documents at the same time. These documents can then freely be simulated or edited.</p>
<p>
All commands can be either selected from the menu or tool bar. The use of the tool bars is through the self-explanatory pictograms intuitive, and therefore, an extra explanation of their usage is omitted here. Nevertheless, an invocation of a command by the menu bar or the tool bar is equivalent. Commands and/or functionality, which are currently not available in this version of HPSim, are shaded gray.</p>
