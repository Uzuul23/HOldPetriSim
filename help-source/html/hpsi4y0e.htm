Overlapping graphical objects will be placed one over another in the order the were inserted in the document. In other words, a later added object can partially or totally cover another object. This characteristic can be utilized to draw more advanced geometric figures than they are available from the “Tools” menu. It is shown in the following pictures, how to create a circle segment by placing two rectangle objects and one circle object appropriately.</p>

<img src="../images/popupbu.gif" border=0> All currently marked objects will be moved to the top of the object pile, when selecting the menu entry “Arrange<font face="Wingdings"><span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#224;</span></font>Popup”.</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/backbu.gif" border=0> All currently marked objects will be moved to the bottom of the object pile, when selecting the menu entry “Arrange<font face="Wingdings"><span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#224;</span></font>Pushback”.</p>
<p>
The commands ”Popup” and ”Pushback” are useful for selecting covered objects. When one object is covered by another, it can not be selected. This makes it necessary to push it up, before selecting it.</p>
