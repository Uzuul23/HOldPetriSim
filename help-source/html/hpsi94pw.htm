<p>
<img src="../images/selbu.gif" border=0> Choose the tool “Select” from the “Tools” menu. To select an object, just click with the left mouse button on it. The selected object changes its appearance to reflect the selection you made.</p>
<p>
In case of several overlapping objects under the mouse pointer, only the most upper object will be selected.</p>
<p>
A multiple selection can be achieved by dragging with the mouse a rectangle. All objects, which area is fully embraced by the rectangle by the drawn rectangle, will be selected after releasing the mouse button.</p>
<p>
Each new selection supersedes the previous selection of one or more objects. By pressing the key “ESC” or clicking with the mouse in an empty area of the window, you can cancel the selection as well.</p>
<p>
You can only edit the properties of an object, when you have selected it first.</p>
