<p>
In HPSim you can have for each document several open Editor Windows, but only one Status Window.</p>
<p>
The feature to have several views of the type Editor Window may facilitate the work with big nets, when using different zoom factors in the various editor windows. You can keep track on important details in one editor window, while not loosing the overview of the entire net in another editor window. Editing of the net in one Editor Window will be immediately effective in all other windows of the same net. As can be seen in the picture, the document HPS4 has two Editor Windows.</p>
